# 👋 Hi, I'm Connor! 
## About Me
I'm a Computer Science student in my first-year studying at Purdue University. I started programming in high school in computer science class and found I enjoy coding and creating software. Currently, I'm currently working towards my degree in Computer Science and with Sandia National Labortories through Purdue's Data Mine Coporate Partnerships on predicting flight trajectories. I enjoy watching sports, playing golf, learning efficently as possible and playing games in my free time.
