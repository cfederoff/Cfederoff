# 👋 Hi, I'm Connor! 
## About Me
I'm a computer science student in my first-year studying at Purdue University. I started programming in high school during computer science class and found I enjoy coding and creating software. Currently, I'm working towards my degree and with Sandia National Laboratories through Purdue's Data Mine corporate partnerships to predict flight trajectories. I enjoy watching sports, playing golf, learning as efficiently as possible, and playing games in my free time.
